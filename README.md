Sentiment Analysis of Telecom Industry Decisions
 
Use Case :- Airtel Plans

PROBLEM STATEMENT
 
In the Telecom sector the plans that an operator offers change very frequently with customer response to it. Everytime or say very often a company offers data and calling plans and there are very limited ways to know “do these plans auger well with the customer or customer feels positive and satisfied with them?”.Also there remains an issue of time lags as there are limited sources to measure responses to a plan with streaming data flow and Cognitive driven analysis. It delays the decision making by the management.The widespread access and prevalent use of social media as forums to discuss these data and pricing wars, provides a scope for analysis of customer sentiment towards any new plan and offer. If a customer finds any  dissatisfaction so he finds himself comfortable to convey his problem only on social platforms.
 
DESCRIPTION
 
Here we address the issue stated above. First we describe the different metrics for positive and negative responses to any plan that is offered by an operator and  the concerns expressed by the customers-
1. 	Pricing of the plan;
2. 	Data offered with plan;
3. 	Validity period;
4. 	Calling offers in the plan;
5. 	SMS offers in the plan.
 
 
Using different machine learning approaches and classification algorithms we will identify the most important factors and analyse their impact. We strive to use pattern recognition techniques to establish relationship between the responses to newly introduced plans and monthly and quarterly revenue.
 
We also give structure to the unstructured responses by classification algorithms mainly Support Vector Machines, Principal Component Analysis and Correlation Clustering into five categories
 
1- Highly negative;
2- Moderately negative;
3- Dissatisfied;
4- Moderately positive;
5- Highly Positive
 
We also provide demographic data on the respondents and their locations which provide special decision making ability to Target specific customer base. Using this we find out patterns of preferences of different categories of customers. This will help operator in introducing tailor-made plans for different Telecom circles and targeting different customer base.
 
Data will be collected through Web scraping of social media forums and API's of large social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter. This unstructured data is preprocessed through our preprocessing methodologies.
 
Our Cognitive based platform will analyse data at special events like introduction of a new plan and score Customer Impact by it.

 
This also helps the Management to restructure the billing plan in a way that it gets alot positive responses and adds to the marketing campaign of the company.
